In your project, you used the addition + operator to change costumes depending on a 'My Blocks'{:class='block3myblocks'} input.

If we have these costumes:

![Images of all the costumes: costume1 is a transparent petal; costume 2 is a purple petal; costume 3 is a transparent globe; and costume 4 is a purple globe.](images/costumes_quiz.png)

Which of the following code blocks would get your pattern to switch from the purple petal to the purple globe?

- (x)

 ```blocks3
 when flag clicked
 switch costume to ((costume [number v]) + (2))
 ```

  --- feedback ---

Yes, the costume number you are on is costume 2 and the costume you want to switch to is costume 4 so you will need to switch to costume 2 + 2 = 4.

 ```blocks3

 switch costume to ((costume [number v]) + (1))
 ```

This will switch from costume 2 to costume 2 + 1 = 3. Costume 3 is the transparent globe, not the purple globe.

 ```blocks3
 when flag clicked
 switch costume to ((costume [number v]) - (1))
 ```

  --- feedback ---

This will switch from costume 2 to costume 2 - 1 = 1. Costume 1 is the transparent petal, not the purple globe.

- ( )

 ```blocks3
 when flag clicked
 switch costume to ((1)+(1))
 ```

  --- feedback ---

This will switch the costume to `costume 2`{:class='block3looks'} regardless of which costume is currently being shown.
