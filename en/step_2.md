You should see a shape sprite that looks a bit like a flower petal.

You will use **functions** (`my blocks`{:class="block3myblocks"}) to create a pattern with this shape. You may remember creating functions to organise your code in [Nature rover](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/nature-rover/3), and to repeat the same code in [Puzzle room](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/puzzle-room/4). Functions can also be used to reuse actions in a different way.

--- task ---

Go to `My Blocks`{:class='block3myblocks'} and name your function (we have called it `pattern:`{:class="block3myblocks"}). Add `repeat`{:class="block3myblocks"} as a label to identify the first input â€” or what programmers call a **parameter**. Then click **Add an Input** to actually create the **parameter** called `repeat`{:class="block3myblocks"}.

```blocks3
define pattern: repeat (repeat)
```

--- /task ---

To design how a pattern is made, the first step is to `define pattern`{:class='block3myblocks'}.

--- task ---

Drag the `repeat`{:class='block3myblocks'} parameter from `define pattern`{:class='block3myblocks'} into a `repeat`{:class='block3control'} loop block.

```blocks3
define pattern: repeat (repeat)
repeat (repeat)
```

--- /task ---

You will now use `clone`{:class='block3control'} blocks to make the same block appear a number of times. Make sure you also add code to change the size and position of the sprite, otherwise the sprites will be stacked on top of each other and you will not be able to see them.

--- task ---

Add some code into the `repeat`{:class='block3myblocks'} loop of your `pattern`{:class='block3myblocks'} function.

![The shape sprite.](images/shape_sprite.png)
```blocks3
define pattern: repeat (repeat)
repeat (repeat)
+ change size by (10) //So you can see the clones
+ move (5) steps //So you can see the clones
+ create clone of (myself v)
```

--- /task ---

**Tip:** `Defining`{:class='block3myblocks'} the function makes a general pattern outline. What you are creating with this function is similar to a spirograph stencil; it is a tool that enables the pattern to be created later. 

--- task ---

Create a pattern with your function. Get the `pattern`{:class='block3myblocks'} to `repeat`{:class='block3myblocks'} a number of times `when flag clicked`{:class='block3events'}. 

![The shape sprite.](images/shape_sprite.png)
```blocks3
when flag clicked
show //Shape is displayed 
set size to (50) % //Not too big
go to x: (0) y: (0) //Displayed in the middle
pattern: repeat (3) ::custom
```

**Test:** See what your pattern looks like by clicking the green flag to run your program.

--- /task ---

You should see the beginning of a mandala pattern. Adding more **parameters**, or requirements, to your pattern function will create the first part of your mandala.
