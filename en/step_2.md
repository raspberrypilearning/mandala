Open [the Scratch starter project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/CHANGE/editor/){:target="_blank"}. Scratch will open in another browser tab. 

If you are working offline, you can download the starter project at [](https://rpf.io/p/en/puzzle-room). <mark>check links and change</mark>

<mark>not sure what we decided in terms of a starter project, have forgotten! This may need to be tweaked.</mark>

You should see a shape sprite that looks a little bit like a flower petal.

You will use **functions** or `my blocks`{:class="block3myblocks"} to create a pattern with this shape. You may remember creating functions to organise your code in [Nature Rover](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/nature-rover/3), and to make it so you do not have to write the same code over and over again in [Puzzle Room](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/puzzle-room/4). Functions can also be used to optimise your programs/projects.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Optimisation**</span> makes computer programs as efficient as possible using as little memory (or lines of code, or blocks) as possible. <mark>think of best example</mark>

Go to `My Blocks`{:class='block3myblocks'} and choose blah blah
