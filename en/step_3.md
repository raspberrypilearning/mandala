## Make a mandala

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Create more patterns to make a mandala!
</div>
<div>

Now that you have a basic pattern you can use your `pattern`{:class="block3myblocks"} function a number of times, to make a repeating pattern. By using the same code over and over again, you are making a program that has been **optimised**.

--- task ---

Beneath your `when flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block, add in a few more **calls** to your `pattern`{:class="block3myblocks"} function.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
pattern (3) (10) (5) (60) ::custom
pattern (5) (10) (45) (30) ::custom
pattern (6) (10) (90) (30) ::custom
```

--- task ---

Click the green flag, and see what pattern is produced. You can change the numbers to experiment with patterns that you like, or even add in more calls to your `pattern`{:class="block3myblocks"} function.
