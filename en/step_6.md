## Choose your mandala

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Everyone is different. Give the person using your mandala program a choice based on what they find most peaceful.

You should now have at least two different mandalas. You can use a **function** to create a start menu, giving a choice to whoever is using your mandala program. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Start menus**</span> are often found in games and apps. They let the person playing the game or using the app, pick from a number of options, for example, what character they want to play, or what settings they want.
